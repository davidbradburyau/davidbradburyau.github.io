									<p>The project will ostensibly be a business IT solution including an office IP network solution combined with an audio-visual with automation control system and CCTV security system with cloud-based information and email access and interpersonal capabilities to be sold as a supported package for a one-off fee for implementation (including hardware and labour) and a reoccurring monthly support fee for maintenance/ any additional features or update that need to be made.
The package will be set up so as clients can add or remove certain features to tailor the system for their needs and budgets.<br>
<br>
Office Network <br>
The main network will have to be a scalable IP network for employees’ machines with a lighting, sound system, video streaming capabilities as well as an IP CCTV surveillance system. As a result, there will have to be multiple VLANs to manage network traffic and security as there will be high bandwidth demanding products such as the CCTV system and video streaming products. VLAN stands for Virtual Are Network and is a way of segregating one whole network into partitions through software to streamline traffic management  and security without having to physically rewire a local area network. It also has provisions to allow communication between separate VLANs for applications such as an automation system to access security cameras between separate VLANs.
The VLANS will be configured as follows; <br>
VLAN 1- Management <br>
VLAN2- Employees Machines/Main business network.<br>
VLAN2- Media/ Music/ Video (must allow STP for mesh music products)<br>
VLAN4- Guest network (Highly restricted for internet access only)<br>
VLAN 5- CCTV security network<br>
VLAN 6- Access Control System<br>
This network will have a monitoring agent which will have cloud based real time monitoring of all IP devices with notifications set up when devices (especially mission critical) go down. This monitoring agent will be monitored by the service provider so as any issues can be resolved asap.
There will be multiple Wifi SSIDs setup with varying degrees of privileges mainly a second SSID for limited guest access.
The Video system will consist of PC sources running into an IP Based HDMI matrix for distribution of content to screens around the office such as advertisement as well as entertainment for the break room. This will be controlled via a Control4 automation system for ease of operation. The Audio System will be IP Based wireless mesh sound system with units scattered around the office for background music also controlled via the automation system.
The CCTV system will be an IP based with cameras on their own secure VLAN being recorded on a Network Video Recorder with drivers I the Automation system to remotely view certain cameras.<br>
There will be an option for an IP based intercom and access control system. This will perform the task of timed access to the building for employees and other services with the ability to change access privileges for anyone easily from anywhere I the world. This can be set up with codes, RFID fobs or Bluetooth from IOS and Android devices. It will also have indoor touchscreens for answering the intercom.
There will also be an IP based air conditioning interface for 2 way control of the comfort of the building accessible from anywhere in the world so employees (with the correct privileges) can set the office temperature ready for a days work well before arrival.
